### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andrew, a software engineer based in the SF Bay Area. I'm currently employed as a fullstack engineer at a healthtech startup. In my spare time, I make games, collect music, and play rhythm games.

### Projects
* [Heroes of Umbra](https://store.steampowered.com/app/645380/Heroes_of_Umbra/) - A side-scrolling platformer RPG with networked multiplayer. Built an engine with libgdx and developed it from 2012-2018, with occasional updates and help from the community.
* [Starless Umbra](https://starlessumbra.com/) - a 2D co-op action JRPG-in-progress. This started as an RPG Maker project from 2002-2013 and, after many failed attempts at creating an engine as easy-to-use as RPG Maker, is now built in Gamemaker.

### Support
* If you like what I do and want to help me hire more help on my projects, please consider [donating](https://ko-fi.com/zexyu) on ko-fi.
